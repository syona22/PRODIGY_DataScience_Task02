# PRODIGY_DataScience_Task02
# The dataset of Titanic consists of 12 columns and 891 rows. It is a mix of categorical variables and numerical variables. 
# The dataset consists of columns PassengerID, Survived, Pclass(Passenger Class), Name, Sex, Age, SibSp(Siblings/Spouse), Parch(Parent/Children), Ticket, Fare, Cabin and Embarked.
# The data is imported and is inspected. The information is extracted to see the datatypes and column names. The data is then cleaned by checking if there are null values and also visualising it. The column Cabin has a large number of null values, so we eliminate that columns. The column age is filled in place of null values by using median method. The Embarked column is filled in by the highest value count of the category 'S'. The data type is then changed for the columns Survived, PClass, Sex, Age and Embarked. Then EDA is done first visualising the Gender distribution, histogram for Age distribution, Survival Analysis on Gender and Pclass, Distribution of Embarked, Correlation between Age and Fare, understanding the outliers for Age, count plot for Sibsp and Parch and finding the distribution of passengers based on family size to know who survived.
